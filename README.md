# vertex-cover-problem

Python based code for finding approximately optimal solutions of the Vertex-Cover problem using both classical and quantum approaches. To run the quantum code on D-Wave's systems, a developer API is required that one can obtain by signing up for a trial account.

1. Install the requirements from the requirements.txt file.

2. In the notebook, use your API token from D-Wave in the field where the token is set.

3. Set solver_location = 1, if you want to run the simulations locally on your computer, or set it to 1 if you want to run it on D-Wave's systems.
