# vertex-cover-problem

Python based code for finding optimal solutions of the (NP-Complete) Vertex-Cover problem and mapping it to a Quantum Annealer.

1. Install the requirements from the requirements.txt file.

2. In the notebook, use your API token from D-Wave in the field where the token is set.

3. Set solver_location = 1, if you want to run the simulations locally on your computer, or set it to 1 if you want to run it on D-Wave's systems.
